# BOT IN DISCORD USING PYTHON

## by Alejandro Vaca 🇲🇽

### I apologize for my English.

The reason for using the __*Dog API*__ is that when using the meme API, at least in my case, it seemed to no longer work, as the URL responded with the following JSON.


```{"code":503,"message":"Unknown error while getting posts. Please try again"}```



This is what the bot shows with the command "$dog"
